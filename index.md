# Favorite CPSC 120L Labs


Lab 05 pt. 2:

I really liked this section of this lab for the reason that it applied to my other courses I am currently taking. This lab felt like I was learning useful information that I can actually take with me into my other coursework which will benefit me by helping me save time and delete room for error in my work. The code helped me make conversions from numerous different units of measure and helped convert them from one unit to another. I am doing this in my physics courses both lab and lecture and even in some of the math courses that I am taking and will be taking later on here at CSUF. This lab also had us creating a truncating function which I found was very interesting and while challenging to make, rewarding once we figured out how to properly code it and helping my partner and I both learn about the importance of clarity of code when building “if” statements and them containing both “if else” and “else” statements within the “if” statement. 


Lab 07:

This lab was interesting as we had to do two two different sets of instructions to perform what was being asked of us. A function and a main set of instructions to follow. I found this lab interesting based on my partner and I’s necessity to identify whether or not we needed to use && or || when deciding whether or not the car was able to park on the street being tested at that point in the code. This proved fairly difficult for both of us but we were able to figure it out and this lab I felt in particular I took a lot of awareness from. Personally within this lab I was stuck in the design, compile, run cycle for a long time but it helped me get used to this process and learn more about the frustration and importance of patience while coding. 


Lab 08 pt. 2:

I particularly found that this part of this particular lab is extremely satisfying. When running the code it prints out this sequence and pattern which fills the terminal with different keyboard symbols in an aesthetic pattern which was fun to not only watch print but impressive to me considering that it was printed using code. I know how patterns are very important in code and I think this part of this lab highlighted that and put an emphasis on the capabilities of code. Not to mention this lab gave us the ability to learn about runtime errors as my partner and I faced that within this lab and was able to see and learn from an error we made in coding that resulted in a never ending sequence of code.
